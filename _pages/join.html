        <h2>Attend ACM</h2>
        <p>The best way you can get involved is to coming to regular Friday meetings. The meetings kick-off with some announcements, and then we go over our upcoming events. Then we give everyone an opporunity to share project updates or anything that they have been working on. The meetings conclude with lightning talks, where students give a talk on any topic of their choice. It's a great way to hear what's going on in the tech world or increase your public speaking ability!</p>
